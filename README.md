# MusimNeNc
MultiSimNeNc is a novel network-based method for identifying modules in various types of networks by integrating network representation learning (NRL) and clustering algorithms.

## Introduction
MultiSimNeNc integrate the two fields of network representation learning (NRL) and data clustering. This method can capture the multi-order similarity of different types of networks using graph convolution (GC) and integrate this similarity information to enhance the modular structure of the network, and also find the optimal number of modules using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to overcome the shortcoming that most module identification algorithms require the prior specification of the number of modules.
